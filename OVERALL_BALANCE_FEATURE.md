# Overall Balance Feature (Like Splitwise)

## Overview
The Overall Balance feature provides a comprehensive view of all money owed and owed to you across ALL groups, not just within individual groups. This is similar to Splitwise's main dashboard where you can see your total financial position with all friends regardless of which groups they're in.

## Access the Feature

### From Home Screen
- Tap the **wallet icon** (üí∞) in the top-right corner of the Home Screen
- Opens the "Overall Balance" screen

## What You'll See

### 1. **User Name Input**
At the top, enter your name as it appears across all groups:
- Default: "Me"
- Must match your name in groups exactly
- Tap refresh icon to recalculate
- The system uses this to identify you across all groups

### 2. **Summary Cards**

#### You Owe (Red Card)
- Total amount you owe to all people across all groups
- Shows the sum of all negative balances

#### Owed to You (Green Card)
- Total amount owed to you by all people across all groups
- Shows the sum of all positive balances

#### Net Balance (Large Card)
- Your overall position: `Owed to You - You Owe`
- üü¢ Green with ‚¨áÔ∏è: You're getting money back (positive)
- üü† Orange with ‚¨ÜÔ∏è: You need to pay money (negative)

### 3. **People List**

Shows everyone you have financial interactions with across all groups:

**For each person:**
- Name and avatar
- Total amount owed/owing
- Expandable to see group-by-group breakdown
- Color-coded:
  - üü¢ Green (‚¨áÔ∏è): They owe you money
  - üî¥ Red (‚¨ÜÔ∏è): You owe them money

**Expand a person to see:**
- Which groups you share with them
- Individual balance in each group
- Breakdown of where the debt comes from

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Case

**Groups:**
1. "Trip to NYC" - You, Alice, Bob
2. "Dinner Group" - You, Alice, Carol

**Expenses:**
- NYC Trip: Alice paid $300, split 3 ways ‚Üí You owe Alice $100
- Dinner: You paid $90, split 3 ways ‚Üí Alice owes you $30, Carol owes you $30

**Overall Balance Screen Shows:**
```
You Owe: $70           (to Alice: $100 - $30 = $70)
Owed to You: $30       (from Carol: $30)
Net Balance: -$40      (You need to pay $40 overall)

People:
‚îú‚îÄ Alice: You owe $70
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Trip to NYC: $100 (you owe)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Dinner Group: $30 (owes you)
‚îî‚îÄ Carol: Owes you $30
   ‚îî‚îÄ Dinner Group: $30 (owes you)
```

### Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Group

**Groups:**
1. "Roommates" - You, Alice, Bob
2. "Weekend Trip" - You, Alice, Carol
3. "Office Lunch" - You, Bob, David

**After various expenses:**

**Overall Balance might show:**
```
You Owe: $125
Owed to You: $200
Net Balance: +$75 ‚úì (You get back $75)

People (sorted by amount):
‚îú‚îÄ Alice: Owes you $120

### 2. **Intelligent Matching**

- No need to manually link accounts

### 3. **Detailed Breakdown**

- See which groups contribute to their balance
- Understand where each debt comes from

### 4. **Real-time Updates**

## How Balances Are Calculated

### Step 1: Calculate Within Each Group
For each group, calculate individual balances as normal:
```
Balance = Total Paid - Total Share
```

### Step 2: Aggregate by Person
Sum up balances for each person across all groups:
```
Alice's Total = Alice's balance in Group1 + Alice's balance in Group2 + ...
```

### Step 3: Show Net Position
From your perspective:
- Positive balance ‚Üí They owe you
- Negative balance ‚Üí You owe them

### Step 4: Account for Settlements
Settlement payments are already factored into group balances, so overall balance automatically reflects them.

### 3. **Cross-Group Clarity**

- Make informed settlement decisions

### 4. **Quick Assessment**
- Three numbers tell the whole story:
  - How much you owe total
  - How much is owed to you total
  - Your net position
